# Versioning

In mono-repos, it is common to have multiple versions of the same package. For example, you might have a `@wayofdev/components` package that is used by both `@wayofdev/web` and `@wayofdev/mobile`. In this case, you might want to have a different version of `@wayofdev/components` for `@wayofdev/web` and `@wayofdev/mobile`. This is where the `package.json` `version` field comes in. The `version` field is used to specify the version of the package. The version is a string that must follow the [semver](https://semver.org/) format. For example, `1.0.0` is a valid version, but `1.0` is not.

For versioning automation we use [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets). It is a tool that helps you manage your versions and changelogs with a focus on multi-package repositories. It is designed to work well with a continuous integration system and can be used with any workflow you like. It is also designed to work with any package manager, but in mono-repos we are using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io).
